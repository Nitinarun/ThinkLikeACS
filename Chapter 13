Ribosomes make proteins using ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
 The ribosome reads the instructions found in the messenger RNA molecules
 in a cell and builds proteins from these mRNAs by chemically linking 
together amino acids (these are the building blocks of proteins) in 
 the order defined by the mRNA.
 
 This text is used for Chapter 13.11 Exercise Qn 2: 
The Pythonidae, commonly known simply as pythons, from the Greek word
python, are a family of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia,
and Australia.
Most members of this family are ambush predators, in that they typically
remain motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at 
passing prey.
